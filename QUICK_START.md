## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Choose Your Technology Stack
Review `docs/TECHNOLOGY_GUIDE.md` to select:
- **Framework**: Electron, Tauri, Qt, Native
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, C++, Python
- **Web Engine**: Chromium, WebKit, System WebView

### 2. Review Development Plan  
Check `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the 8-milestone development plan:
1. **Basic Web Rendering** (1-2 weeks)
2. **Navigation Controls** (1-2 weeks)  
3. **Tabbed Interface** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Bookmark Management** (2-3 weeks)
5. **Ad/Tracker Blocking** (3-4 weeks)
6. **Private Browsing** (2-3 weeks)
7. **Settings & Preferences** (3-4 weeks)
8. **Cross-Platform Packaging** (4-5 weeks)

### 3. Set Up Development Environment
Based on your chosen stack, install:
- Language runtime and package manager
- Framework SDK and tools
- Build system and dependencies
- Testing framework

### 4. Start with Milestone 1
Begin implementing basic web page rendering:
- Create main application window
- Integrate web engine
- Add URL input and navigation
- Test with simple web pages

## 📋 Key Features to Implement

- ✅ Web page browsing with modern engine
- ✅ Tabbed interface for multi-site browsing  
- ✅ Navigation controls (back/forward/reload/home)
- ✅ Bookmark management and organization
- ✅ Built-in ad and tracker blocking
- ✅ Private/incognito browsing mode
- ✅ User settings and preferences
- ✅ Cross-platform distribution

## 🔒 Privacy Principles

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only essential data
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally by default
- **User Control**: Granular privacy controls
- **Transparency**: Open source, auditable implementation
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or telemetry without consent

## 📚 Documentation Available

- **ROADMAP.md**: Complete 8-milestone development plan
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System design and module structure  
- **TECHNOLOGY_GUIDE.md**: Technology comparison and recommendations
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributors
- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: Detailed directory structure explanation

## ⚡ Recommended First Implementation

For rapid prototyping, consider starting with:
- **Electron + TypeScript** for fastest development
- **React/Vue** for UI components
- **SQLite** for local data storage
- Focus on Milestone 1 (basic web rendering)
